							<p>
								Rita Machado, a Lisbon native, has worked as a TV producer since she was seventeen but really wants to live a stress-free life on a farm. She sings along to pop music when she’s driving her tiny car skillfully around Lisbon’s narrow streets and she enjoys showing foreigners her hometown. She also likes weekend getaways to her family’s summerhouse in Sintra and she loves Lisbon’s many lookout points. Rita dislikes opportunism, arrogance, cream cheese, butter and everything else white that you can eat.

							<p>
								Francisco Ferreira is from Évora, Portugal and has lived in Lisbon since 1999 working in television and fashion. As observed by Rita, the life of Francisco is ‘party, party, party’. As observed by Francisco, there’s nothing quite like a shot or two of Jägermeister on a Friday night. Francisco likes the theater, dinner with friends and dancing the night away in one of Lisbon’s many clubs. Fran is too modest to say it but he actually knows every single person in Lisbon.

						<h4>Old Yellow Trams</h4>
						<div class="wrapper">

						<p>
							From Graça, we walked down through the neighborhood of Alfama in Lisbon’s old town. Alfama is known for its winding, hilly streets and tiny alleyways. Soak up Lisbon’s character here and keep an eye out for ‘Azulejos’, the beautiful ceramic tiles found on Portuguese building façades.

						<h4>Mesa de Frades</h4>
						<div class="wrapper">
						<p>
							A little restaurant in Alfama that hosts Fado performances at midnight on Saturdays. Fado is traditional Portuguese sea-faring music. It’s a beautiful, sad kind of music about loss and love and life. Best enjoyed in the dark with locals.

						<h4>Cabo de Roca</h4>
						<div class="wrapper">
						<p>
							The furthest westerly point of mainland Europe. Great lighthouse, cliffs and a little secluded beach you can walk down to. Sunsets here are breathtaking and it’s also a fine spot for a good ol’ fashioned howl at the moon. Cabo de Roca is about a 30-minute drive from Lisbon.

						<h4>Cristo Rei Statue</h4>
						<div class="wrapper">
						<p>
							The cardinal of Lisbon went to Rio and was like, ‘Man, they’ve got a cool statue of Jesus here, we gotta get us one of them!’ So they did. Go to the top because the view of Lisbon and the 25 de Abril Bridge is spectacular.

						<p>
							This Is My City normally wouldn’t set foot on a touristy boat cruise. But seeing Berlin from the river Spree is really quite relaxing and you get a nice overview of the old city center, the museums and the impressive parliament buildings. Still, it’s against our principles.

							Berlin can be fancy too. This restaurant and bar is set above Berlin’s rooftops in Kreuzberg. The red elevator that takes you up the side of the building is wicked and the food is great too. Enjoy a cocktail one floor up from the restaurant after dinner and admire the interior design and the city views.

							This bar is a good place to end a great weekend in Berlin. At least we thought so. An old furniture shop, it has remnants of its furniture heritage glued to the walls and ceiling.

			<h2>About the show</h2>

			<div class="content cols">
				<p>Ever dream of quitting your day job and taking the trip of a lifetime? Ever wish you could ditch the guidebook and go straight to where the locals go?</p>

				<p>For each episode of This Is My City, Tim and Thomas find a local who is willing to show them what life is really like in Lisbon, Beirut, Beijing and five other global metropolises… Over the course of a madcap weekend, they film everything that transpires, no matter how dangerous, bizarre or borderline illegal.</p> 

				<p>Tim Kafalas and Thomas Beug first met in New York in 2004. They bonded over a shared love for losing themselves in foreign lands. They were also both serious about filmmaking. Thomas, an Irishman, was a producer at Droga5, a Creativity Magazine Advertising Agency of the Year while Tim, American, worked as a video editor at MTV.</p> 

				<p>This Is My City is a show about what cities mean to the people who live in them, brought to you in the most personal way. It’s not about seeing the sights; it’s about seeing the soul.</p>

				<p>This is a self-funded, self-produced passion project. We’d like to sincerely thank everyone who helped out along the way to make it all possible. We hope you enjoy it.</p>
