<p class="normal">Beijing was smoggy, foggy and then snowy. The upside to fogsmog is that it catches the light and makes you think you’re a great cinematographer. The downside to smogfog is that unhealthy feeling in your nose, eyes and mouth. Snow is always only good.</p>

<p class="normal">Lin Lin WAS Beijing for us. 5ft nothing, heels, wicked style, smart, witty, mischievous and just a wee bit talented. Her design company <a href="http://www.jellymon.com/" target="_blank"><span class="main">Jellymon</span></a> means business and so does she.</p>

<p class="normal">On rare occasions, the momentum of a day and night takes control of you. There are no more decisions, no left or right turns, no stops and starts. You just have to hold on for dear life and enjoy the ride. Saturday in Beijing was one of those days. <br /><br />
11:30 – We roll into the late morning on bicycles – the only way to get around this town. One bicycle in Beijing may carry a person, a family, a workshop, a tower of eggs, a dozen kegs of beer or all of the above simultaneously.</p>

<p class="normal">Lin Lin’s bicycle was much cooler than our rentals. Major bike envy for me.</p>

<p class="normal">14:00 – We have lunch in Chu Xiang Qing, a little family-owned restaurant in an old unpaved backstreet right in the middle of the ultra modern Central Business District. This is where all the construction workers who built the CBD were fed. Skyscrapers crowd around us as we eat noodles, more noodles and then the best dumplings I’ve ever had in my life.</p>

<p class="normal">16:00 – We get a four-hour private mix session with <a href="http://www.djwordy.com/" target="_blank"><span class="main">DJ Wordy</span></a>, a good friend of Lin Lin’s who also happens to be a three-time DMC champion in China. He DJs, remixes, produces and generally makes people dance for a living. Hard to put into words how bloody amazing this orgasm of music was so I won’t. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPqByTen4eI" target="_blank"><span class="main">You can see him in action here</span></a>. He’s just a tad skillful.</p>

<p class="normal">20:00 – We eat hot pot in a hutong restaurant called Da Great. Mmmmmmm.... Hot pot.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/11_09.jpg" width="560" height="341" alt="Hot Pot" /></p>
<p class="normal">22:00 – We move on to a <a href="http://www.myspace.com/toxavanger" target="_blank"><span class="main">Toxic Avenger </span></a>gig at Yu Gong Yi Shan. A bunch of other DJs spin. DJ Wordy is not impressed. Dancing, messing and befriending ensue. <br />
  <br />
02:00 – We decide to crash a GQ party on the penthouse of a seven star hotel that was built for the Olympics. Personally I thought it felt more like of a six star hotel. Tim is straddled. As usual.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/11_12.jpg" width="560" height="308" alt="Pool Pimpin" /></p>
<p class="normal">04:30 – I get us kicked out of GQ party for stealing cigars. This causes embarrassment for our host. She forgives me in the cab I think. <br /><br />05:30 – We wait with several thousand other people in Tiananmen Square for the daily flag-raising ceremony. It is a massive anti-climax. It’s cold, it’s fogsmoggy and we drag ourselves home. Bloody good day though. Nubi infact.</p>
