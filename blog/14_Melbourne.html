<p class="normal">It’s summer time in Melbourne. They speak English here. And we’re staying in an apartment with our own bedrooms! This is all a little too normal coming from Japan and China and Beirut before that. We’re back in familiar territory, which is a little bit strange after so much strange...</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne1.jpg" width="560" height="420" alt="Skyline" /></p>
<p class="normal">Thankfully, we have a great, great host lined up in Melbourne. <a href="http://beciorpin.com/" target="_blank"><span class="main">Beci Orpin</span></a> is her name and she’s a graphic artist, graphic designer, clothing designer, sculptor, collector, mother of two and a true local Melbournian.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne2.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Orpin" /></p>
<p class="normal">Beci’s house is full of colorful objects and artworks and inspirational things that she has collected over the years.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne3.jpg" width="560" height="1029" alt="Beci's Wall" /></p>
<p class="normal">She seems to like beasts and so beasts abound. Most are fake.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne4.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Beci's Desk" /></p>
<p class="normal">But some are real.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne5.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="cat" /></p>
<p class="normal">In Melbourne, we kept encountering art, design, food and drink (often simultaneously). Creativity and debauchery: a winning combination. There were, for example, some delicious macaroons to be sampled at Di Chirico’s super stylized pop-up bakery.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne6.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Macaroons in Space" /></p>
<p class="normal">And we visited a gallery where Beci had just had an exhibition.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne7.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Beci's Art 1" /></p>
<p class="normal">Red dots everywhere.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne8.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Beci's Art 2" /></p>
<p class="normal">I got some really nice custom <a href="http://www.notetoself.com.au/" target="_blank" class="main">Note to Self jeans</a> made while in town. Yes the fit reference does say ‘36 stretch’...</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne9.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Note To Self" /></p>
<p class="normal">We went to Grace Darling, a pub in Fitzroy. Nice wallpaper, a nice pint of Guinness and a great vintage clothing sale on upstairs.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne10.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Pub" /></p>
<p class="normal">We were also sent to the infamous Revolver nightclub by Beci and told that it really only gets going at 8 o’ clock in the morning. Of course we had to stay to investigate this claim. There were Banskys on the wall behind plates of protective glass. See...more art.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne11.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Bansky" /></p>
<p class="normal">This appears to be the best photograph that was taken that morning...</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne12.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Revolver" /></p>
<p class="normal">Beci also introduced us to Brendan, an artist and lead singer of the local Melbourne band <a href="http://www.ecsr.com.au/" target="_blank"><span class="main">Eddy Current Suppression Ring.</span></a> He was a lovely man and we saw him play a sold-out gig a little later in our travels at The Annandale Hotel in Sydney. Wicked.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne13.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Eddie Curret" /></p>
<p class="normal">Melbourne being in Australia, it was only a matter of time before we found ourselves barbecuing. Add a dozen kids to the mix and you get a Beci Orpin style barbecue: the perfect hangover cure.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne14.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Kids!!" /></p>
<p class="normal">Our lovely producer/friend/compatriot Amanda took us to her private beach box in Half Moon Bay to close out the weekend.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne15.jpg" width="560" height="420" alt="Amanda" /></p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/Melbourne17.jpg" width="560" height="420" alt="Beach Box Thomas" /></p>
<p class="normal">We ate fish n’ chips, drank beers, jumped in the sea and watched the sunset. It has to be said, life is damn good down under.</p>
