<p class="normal">Tokyo is a megalopolis. If you get to a vantage point, it stretches out as far as the eye can see in every direction. Only Mt. Fuji in the distance suggests that there is an end to the urban undulations. It was a daunting task to shoot in Tokyo and try to wrap heads around something so colossal. Our strategy was, ‘lose yourself, let go, get lost fear and loathing style...’</p>
<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__01.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="City" /></p>
<p class="normal">On the ground, Tokyo is people. Everywhere. All day and all night.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__03.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Club" /></p>
<p class="normal">Masa, a local music-maker and promoter, was our contact.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__04.jpg" width="560" height="620" alt="Masa" /></p>
<p class="normal">Masa put us in touch with Takeki.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__05.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Takeki" /></p>
<p class="normal">Takeki put us in touch with Tokyo.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__06.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Takeki 2" /></p>
<p class="normal">Takeki is a contemporary classical composer. As I write this he is probably playing his own compositions on the emperor’s grand piano to a group of dignitaries at Meiji Jingu. Besides composing, he is in 6 different bands, two of which he leads in a rare style of 70s lyrical J-Pop. He gave us a day and half of his time. We were left wanting more...<br /><br />
There was the miniature Hanayashiki amusement park in Asakusa.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__07.jpg" width="560" height="343" alt="Amusemnt Park" /></p>
<p class="normal">There was the ukulele-playing rapper at Boogie Woogie bar in Ginza.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__08.jpg" width="560" height="343" alt="ukulele" /></p>
<p class="normal">There were Emi Eleonora and Murasaki Baby Doll at Star Pine Café in Kichijoji.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__09.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Murasaki Baby Doll" /></p>
<p class="normal">There was drinking coffee and listening to Debussy at the classical Café Renaissance in Koenji.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__10.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Cafe" /></p>
<p class="normal">And there was the tiny, intimate Yakan Hikou bar in Shinjuku owned by a drag queen barman (or barlady). If you look closely you can see a sassy photo of her with cigarette in hand on the wall in the background.</p>

<p class="normal">Before we left Tokyo we got a tour of Tsukiji fish market at dawn by Mr. Kouji Matsushita, a sushi chef from Tsutsuji Gaoka who was also known simply as ‘the master’. He navigated the market with a smile and chatted to everyone.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__12.jpg" width="560" height="347" alt="Master" /></p>
<p class="normal">Fish and sea creatures of every kind are killed and cleaned and displayed and packaged with a uniquely Japanese kind of respect. Little to nothing is wasted. That tuna head on the table there for example...</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__13.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Tuna" /></p>
<p class="norma">...would become the centerpiece of a farewell meal.</p>

<p class="normal"><img src="http://thisismycity.tv/blog/pics/13__14.jpg" width="560" height="315" alt="Head" /></p>
<p class="normal">The time was too short. Way too short. But we love you ??.</p>
